termux gcc resurrected purely because scipy needs it. 
Don't annoy fornwall if you find a bug since its 
entirely unsupported. 
This is a compiler of last resort hecause you 
need to compile fortran or something needs gcc and
only gcc.

Added arm gcc with gfortran and libgfortran is now in gcc deb.


If you want to do this yourself its not hard.

I compiled arm and arm64 tool chain for linux x86_64 (the .tar.bz2 file)
so you can extract over the android ndk tool chain for ndk-13 and when termux creates tool chain it should
pull stuff in.

The default makefile for openblas uses hardfp and termux uses softfp so it won't work
on termux. Don't use it on arm use either lapack or atlas. Atlas will likely be faster
than lapack. 

I probably won't bother with this stuff again but hopefully you can work out what to do.
